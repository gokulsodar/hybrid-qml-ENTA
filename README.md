# hybrid-qml-ENTA

A hybrid quantum machine learning framework that combines quantum embeddings with classical machine learning models for enhanced data analysis and pattern recognition.

## Overview

This repository implements a hybrid approach to quantum machine learning (QML) using PennyLane that leverages quantum embeddings to transform classical data into quantum feature spaces, which are then processed by conventional machine learning algorithms. The hybrid methodology aims to harness the potential advantages of quantum computing while maintaining compatibility with existing ML workflows.

## Features

- **Quantum Embeddings**: Transform classical data into quantum feature representations
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Seamless integration of quantum and classical ML components
- **Multiple ML Models**: Support for various classical ML algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
- **Data Preprocessing Pipeline**: Comprehensive data cleaning and feature engineering

## Architecture

```
Classical Data → Preprocessing → Quantum Embeddings → Classical ML Models → Predictions
```

The hybrid approach consists of:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Feature scaling, normalization, and encoding
2. **Quantum Embedding Layer**: Maps classical features to quantum states
3. **Classical ML Layer**: Processes quantum-embedded features using traditional algorithms
4. **Evaluation Module**: Performance metrics and comparative analysis

## Usage

The framework provides a complete pipeline for hybrid quantum machine learning experiments including data preprocessing, quantum embedding generation, classical model training, and performance evaluation.

## Quantum Embeddings

The framework supports multiple quantum embedding strategies:

- **Amplitude Embedding**: Encodes classical data in quantum amplitudes
- **Angle Embedding**: Maps features to rotation angles
